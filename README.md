# ftrace-seminar-paper
A seminar paper explaining ftrace and how to use it for understanding linux kernel internals, illustrated at tracing the way of a TCP packet through the kernel

## Purpose
The main goal of this seminar paper is to help aspiring linux kernel developers undersanding the kernel by:
  1. Explaining a tool to understand and trace what's happening inside the kernel (```ftrace```)
  2. Giving an (rough) overview of tcp networking and the involved functions. (This also serves as example for 1.)

## Overview
The main contents are:
* Explaining tracing
* Short guide to ```ftrace``` and ```trace-cmd```
* Describing a concrete Experiment, tracing the way of data through the kernel
* Presentation of the results
* Explanation and discussion of the trace data.
